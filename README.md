## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine
Dogot engine is a 2D and 3D game engine that can be used to create games and simulations. 

### Architecture
The engine is divided into systems that are updated every frame. Nodes, are a composition of Components provided by the systems. Nodes are created from data files by a Factory and placed in scenes. Objects communicate through events or direct access to other objects.

* Component Based (TODO: write up)
* Dynamic Composition (TODO: write up)
* Core Engine Components (TODO: write up)
* Common System Components (TODO: write up)
* Component Dependencies (TODO: write up)
* Scenes (TODO: write up)
* Data Systems and Archetypes (TODO: write up)
* Events (TODO: write up)
* Resources (TODO: write up)
* Resource Packages (TODO: write up)

### Features
Dogot has many features including (but not limited to):

- Editor - An editing environment where you can craft your scenes and preview your games or simulations.
- Built-in Scripting Language - Dogot comes with a powerful built-in scripting language (DGScript) which has tight integration with the engine and editor. DGScript can be used both for your games, and for extending the editor.
- Native Plugins - If DGScript is not enough, you extend Dogot via the plugin system, or write plugins in C++ which are automatically exposed to your game.
- Built-in Physics Engine - Dogot comes with a custom physics engine. It allows you to work with rigid bodies, joints, forces, and other components to craft beautiful simulations.
- Scriptable rendering engine - Dogot comes with a very powerful and flexible renderer. You can use one of the default PBR pipelines, or create your own pipeline via scripts and the powerful data-driven material system.
- Custom shading language - Write your shaders using a variant of the DGScript language, specialized for shaders.

## Free and open source
Dogot is free and open source under the MIT license. You can distribute your Dogot creations as you see fit. You can fork, modify, and distribute the Dogot engine following the very few obligations of the MIT license.
